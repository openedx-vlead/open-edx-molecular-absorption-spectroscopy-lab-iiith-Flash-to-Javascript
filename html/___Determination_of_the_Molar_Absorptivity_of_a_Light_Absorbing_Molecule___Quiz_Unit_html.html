<li>
     What is a calibration curve?
      </li>
<li>
      If the concentration is expressed in mol.m<sup>-3</sup> and path length is expressed in meters, then what will be the units of ε? Relate it tothe units when the concentration is expressed in mol.L<sup>-1</sup> and path length is expressed in cm.
      </li>
<li>
     Why are the values of ε<sub>max</sub> are large for C=C-C=C containing molecules than C=O containing molecules?
      </li>
<li>
     For weakly ionized monoprotic acids, it is safe to use the wavelength corresponding to an isosbestic point for any measurement. Why?
      </li>
<li>
    Two solutions of two substances are showing the same color intensity, even though concentration of one substance is far below the concentration of the other. Why does it happen so? 
      </li>
