Pre-Experiment
</h3>
<ol>
<li>What property of metal particles is used in the study of their formation kinetics?
</li>
<li>Why do gold particles absorb light?
</li>
<li>Why should one use a relatively weak reducing agent like ascorbic acid in the particle enlargement reaction?
</li>
<li>Why does one need to use gold particles in the reduction of eosin by sodium borohydride? </li>
</ol>
<p>
</p><h3>
Post-Experiment
</h3>
<ol>
<li>Do you observe any induction period for the commencement of eosin reduction reaction? 
</li><li>How do you explain the purple color of dispersed gold particles? 
</li><li>What happens to the color of gold particles after its participation in the catalysis?
</li><li>What happens to the color of eosin after its particle catalyzed reduction by sodium borohydride?
</li><li>Does the particle enlargement reaction follow autocatalytic growth over the entire duration of development?
