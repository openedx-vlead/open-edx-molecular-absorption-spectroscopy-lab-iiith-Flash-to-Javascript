	What is the ratio of absorbance values for light absorbing samples slabs of width 2x, 3x and x?
	</li><li>
	Does the transmittance, T = I/I<sub>0</sub> depend on the intensity of the incident light?
	</li><li>
	Say, you have used two transparent cuvettes of 1 cm edge length for the absorbance measurement of a sample.  One cuvette is specially made with a central narrow slab for holding less volume of sample. Compare the absorbance values in both the cases.
	</li><li>
	If you plot absorbance values of the sample vs. path lengths for a particular wavelength for two different concentrations of a substance, where the concentration of one solution is double the other, what difference do you observe in your plot?
	</li><li>
If absorbance is defined as, A = - log<sub>10</sub> T, then what will be the expression of A in terms of % transmittance (%T)? [Hint: %T = 100 × T)
	</li>

<h3>
	Post-Experiment
	</h3>
<ol>
<li>
	In actual measurements, the cuvette is filled to approx. two-third of its volume. What may happen if you take a very small quantity of sample solution, filling say, less than one-third of the cuvette volume?
	</li><li>
	Is the plot of absorbance values vs. path lengths for a particular wavelength always linear? Discuss your answer.
	</li><li>
	If you have a concentrated solution of a light absorbing substance, which path length cuvette – 1 mm or 10 mm – would you prefer for your measurement?
	</li><li>
	Can one use a reference cuvette (for blank) having path length different from the sample cuvette? Discuss your answer.
	</li><li>
	We know that A = (constant) × ℓ. The (constant) is the slope of the line obtained from absorbance vs. path length plot. Is the value of (constant) the same for all absorbance vs. path length plots? Why?
