<h3>
Pre-Experiment
</h3>
<ol>
<li>Under which conditions does the Beer-Lambert law become additive?
</li> <li>If absorbance of two components is 0.80 at an isosbestic point wavelength, what is the ratio of individual component’s absorbance values at that wavelength? 
</li> <li>What will happen to the absorbance if two components having equimolar composition have the same molar absorptivity at a particular wavelength?
</li> <li>Write down the necessary absorbance equations for a three-component solution.
</li> <li>Is this multicomponent sample analysis principle applicable to any pair of light absorbing samples?</li>
</ol>

Post-Experiment
</h3>
<ol>
<li> Determine two isosbestic points for coumarin 343 and coumarin 6.
</li> <li>Why was it necessary to determine the molar absorptivities of a substance at two different wavelengths?
</li> <li>Could your selection of two different wavelengths, λ<sub>1</sub> and λ<sub>2</sub>, for your calculation of unknown concentrations be completely random? Why?
</li> <li>How will you prepare a solution containing 1:1 (v/v) mixture of 2.5×10<sup>-5</sup> M coumarin 343 and 2.0×10<sup>-5</sup> M coumarin 6?
</li> <li>Suppose 2 mL of a component is mixed with equal volume of another component. The first component has absorbance A<sub>1</sub> and the second component has absorbance A<sub>2</sub> at a particular wavelength. What will be the absorbance of the binary mixture at that particular wavelength?
