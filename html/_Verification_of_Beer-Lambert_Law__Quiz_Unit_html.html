<h3>
Pre-Experiment
</h3>
<ol>
<li>Why will the Beer-Lambert law be applicable only for dilute solutions, non-fluorescent substances and for the samples where neither association nor dissociation is present? </li>
<li>If Beer-Lambert law is strictly followed by an absorbing substance, what will happen if the path length is doubled and concentration is halved?</li>
<li>Will the Beer-Lambert law be applicable to vibrational spectroscopy?</li>
<li>What is the origin of the dependence of absorbance on wavelength?</li>
<li>For a very dilute solution (small c, concentration), the intensity of absorbed light is given by, I<sub>abs</sub> = 2.303 I<sub>0</sub> ε c l. Verify it. [Hint: I<sub>abs</sub> = I<sub>0</sub> – I<sub>trans</sub> ]</li>
</ol>
<h3>
Post-Experiment
</h3>
<ol>
<li>Do you expect a similar fall in absorbance values with the decrease in concentration, if you replace potassium dichromate (K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) by potassium dichromate solution? Justify your answer.</li>
<li>What is the value of the intercept of your calibration plot? Justify your answer.</li>
<li>How will a plot of ε versus concentration be different from that of absorbance versus concentration?</li>
<li>Plot transmission versus concentration for a given λ (preferably near λ<sub>max</sub>). How is it different from the absorbance vs. concentration plot? </li>
</ol>
