<li>Which states (ground vs. excited) of the chromophore for the transitions will have higher dipole moment and hence more solvated?
</li><li>Why are K<sub>a</sub> (acid dissociation constant) values expressed as pK<sub>a</sub> like the hydrogen concentration in pH? (Hint: power scale because K<sub>a</sub> values range over many orders of magnitude) 
</li><li>Write the acid dissociation equation for a diprotic acid and express it in terms of pK<sub>a</sub> and pH. Under what conditions will pK<sub>a</sub> be equal to pH?
</li><li>Are all weak acids or bases indicators?
</li><li>Do all indicators change color at pH 7.0? Justify your answer.
</li><li>Explain how one obtains: A = A<sub>a</sub>× [InH<sup>+</sup>]/C<sub>T</sub> + A<sub>b</sub>× [In]/C<sub>T</sub> as given in eq. (6).
</li><li>Show that: [In]/[InH<sup>+</sup>] = (A<sub>a</sub> –A)/(A – A<sub>b</sub>)
</li><li>Find the difference between pK<sub>a</sub> and pH values, when 50% of a drug (which is a weak acid) is ionized.

<li>Can one use methyl orange indicator for any acid-base titrations? Justify your answer.
</li><li>What is the origin of color change in methyl orange during the pH change in solution?
</li><li>Identify the species InH<sup>+</sup> for methyl orange. 
</li><li>What will be the color of methyl orange indicator in pH range 3.1– 4.4 and why? (Hint: color related to indicator name.)
</li><li>What is the color of the methyl orange solution at pH=10? 
</li><li>Why is it necessary to have two extreme pH values about two units higher or lower than the pK<sub>a</sub> of an acid (i.e., extreme pH = pK<sub>a</sub> ± 2)? Calculate the % of conjugate base of the acid under these conditions of extreme pH values. 
</li><li>What is the slope of the plot of pH vs. log of the ratio [In]/[InH<sup>+</sup>]?
</li><li>Which species of methyl orange – standard methyl orange or its conjugate acid – has higher molar extinction coefficient? How did you infer it?
</li><li>How can you relate the wavelengths of maximum absorbance to the colors observed for standard methyl orange and its conjugate acid? </li><li> At what pH of methyl orange solution would equal amounts of the acidic and basic forms be present?
</li><li>Are there any wavelengths at which the absorbance of methyl orange does not change with pH variation?
</li><li>How will the pH of the buffer solutions be affected due to the dilution caused by the addition of the indicator solution to the buffer solution?
