                According to the Beer-Lambert law absorbance is proportional to concentration at each wavelength. In principle, one could choose any wavelength
                for quantitative estimations of concentration. However, we generally select the wavelength of maximum absorbance for a given sample and use it
                in our absorbance measurements. Especially, one should avoid the steep portions of the spectrum. Why?

                Draw two calibration plots for two peak positions of K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub></sub>7. Which linear fit is better? Find out the correlation coefficients of the
                two straight lines.
